In this project, we give a general overview of the current proposals of cryptographic systems that are set to replace the public key systems and digital signature schemes used nowadays. In the first introductory chapter, we give a summary of the principal groups of proposals and some basic notions of cryptography. Then, we study with more detail the fundamentals of quantum computing and how the algorithms that break current systems work. Finally, we give a recap of two groups of schemes that are proposed as alternatives to classical ones: hash-based digital signature schemes, and code-based cryptosystems.
